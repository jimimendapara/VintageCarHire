                    <a href="#" class="blog-title">Making Your Car Rental Experience a Positive One</a>
                    <p>Renting a car should never be stressful, but it frequently is one of those things that can be nerve-wracking. How much will I pay? Which car should I get? Is this place close to the airport? There are more questions that you may have before you book your rental car reservation and we hope to help make it an easy experience for you!

                        When you begin to look for a rental car agency, consider where your trip originates. If you’re flying to your destination, you’ll want a location easily accessible at the airport. Not all car rental companies are at every airport, so you’ll want to find that out first. If you’re driving, finding an office that’s close to your home or in a location that makes it easy for you to get a ride is critical. Even if a price is great, it doesn’t help if you can’t get there.
                        
                        Once you’ve researched agencies available where needed, check the prices. Various agencies run different types of deals. Fox Rent A Car often has specials based on type of car class, time of year or length of rental. If you’re in need of a one-way rental, there may be drop fees in order to cover the cost of returning the vehicle to its original location, so be sure to factor that possibility in when seeking rates. Rates can go up and down within a matter of minutes, so if you find a good deal, your best bet is to book it quickly.
                        
                        Rental agencies make reservations based on when vehicles are expected to return, so keep in mind that if you may need the vehicle longer, you may want to just book it for that length of time. Otherwise, you will face fees for the extra days. Each day you keep it beyond your original rental agreement is a day that they may have promised it to someone else. (This is also the reason that agencies sometimes run out of vehicles, so patience is always appreciated if this occurs, though we do our best to avoid any frustration by getting you a car as quickly as we are able.)
                        
                        Review the policies at your agency online before you head out. This will save you from any surprises and answer most of your questions before you get to the counter. All of our fees, rates, payment policies, etc., are available on our policy page, with a separate listing for each location.
                        
                        You’ll also want to review the vehicle choices. Most of our locations rent from economy to luxury to SUV and van, so peruse the fleet choices. The Fox website lists passengers, typical luggage hold and other amenities to help you decide. We do our best to meet all your needs but we cannot guarantee a specific vehicle, just the class. While we want you in the convertible of your dreams and will do all we can to make that happen, we can only promise that type of vehicle, not one specific model.
                        
                        If you don’t want any add-ons at time of rental, that is entirely your choice. Review the contract before you sign, and if there’s anything on there that you did not want nor understand, please ask your representative first. They will gladly answer any questions. This will save you time later or help prevent any additional fees on your total rental cost.
                        
                        Keep your paperwork, identification and payment source at the ready. You will need it all when you sign for your vehicle and the representative will ask to see it.
                        
                        When you are in your vehicle, feel free to take your time inspecting it. Point out any concerns to your representative and again, use that time to ask questions before you leave the lot. If you are unhappy with the vehicle for any reason, seek help. You do not have to leave with a vehicle you aren’t comfortable with. It is best to handle concerns before you are on the road and it is much faster to get you in a different vehicle while still at the rental agency. This also gives you time to stow your luggage and test out seating arrangements to ensure you all fit and still have space to move freely.
                        
                        If you have problems, we are here to help. We have an online chat option, a toll-free customer care line and of course, our social media pages. Social media is not staffed 24/7 so while they will get to everyone the next business day, they are not online at nights or on weekends; they also are not able to make reservations or handle customer service directly.</p>

                <a href="#" class="blog-title">Benefits of Renting an SUV on Your Next Trip.</a>
                <p>One of the first things people look at when choosing which car to rent is price. An economical rental car lowers the price of a vacation or business trip. The price difference between a small car and a standard SUV is often minimal, and if you take advantage of our 10% discount, you can save even more on your SUV rental. This makes the choice that much easier, but what are the other benefits of renting an SUV for your next road trip?

                    Comfort: SUVs offer you the versatility of having access to your belongings while you’re on the road, while they’re out of your way instead of sitting at your feet or crowded next to you in your row. They offer are made to handle rougher terrain while providing the feel of riding in a car.
                    
                    Handling: A standard SUV offers you the ability to handle inclement weather with ease, giving you smooth turning capability and safe climbing of dirt roads if you’re heading into a campsite or visiting a national park. Responsive steering in an SUV is similar to that of a sedan so you get the benefits of renting an SUV while still having the smooth feel of driving a smaller car.
                    
                    Storage: the ‘trunk’ space in an SUV can handle a lot of luggage, and you can stack higher than you would be able to in a trunk. Of course, you need to leave yourself adequate space to see while on the road, without blocking your rear-view mirror, but you can hang your clothing back there without the worry of them getting grimy or dirty in a trunk. You can also put down the row of seats, and in some SUVs, just one seat, to carry larger items like surfboards. Not having to remove things from a roof rack while parking at a hotel for the night is so convenient.
                    
                    Gas mileage: the miles per gallon in a standard SUV is not significantly different from a smaller car, so you get all that extra space at an affordable price for a tank of gas. (When you rent with Fox, you can pre-pay for gas, or you can return it full. If not, you will be charged to fill the tank, so it is to your benefit to refill before you return the vehicle.)
                    
                    Visibility: most SUVs are a little higher from the road, increasing the visibility for the driver, making driving safer, and passengers also get a better view of their surroundings. That same raised body allows for safer passing over rocks and other things you might experience on uneven terrain. (It’s still best to avoid those types of obstacles, but sometimes that’s difficult or unsafe.)</p>

            <a href="#" class="blog-title">Tips for Buying a New Car</a>
            <p>Buying a new car is usually an exciting moment, but it’s also very stressful. Will I get what I want? Will the dealer push me into something I don’t want? Will I be there for hours and hours? Will I pay too much? To help make the process more enjoyable, we’ve put together a list of the top things you’ll want to consider before you set foot on an auto dealership lot.

                Know your bottom line. This includes not only your final sale price but what you can afford to write a check for all at once at time of sale or for your monthly payment. If you’re set firm on $30,000, be ready to walk away even if your dream car is sitting in front of you. Go through your budget before you go to the dealership so you’re not easily swayed if they give you a higher price than what you can afford.
                Consider your new insurance payment when you’re figuring out your monthly affordability. If you know what you want, you can ask your insurance agent to run a quote so you’re not surprised with the new figures. It may even turn out to be lower than you think, giving you some wiggle room with your car payment.
                Speaking of wiggle room with your car payment, pull up a loan application app on your phone and keep it handy. Familiarize yourself with how much an additional $1000 on your loan costs per month at the average interest rate. This will help you decide if those pricy add-ons are worth it. If you really want a navigational system or an upgraded stereo or those heated leather seats, it may be worth the extra $15 or so per month. 
                Once you’ve signed the paperwork, there is usually no backing out. Different states have different requirements, so be ready to keep the car or deal with the possible negative implications on your credit should you change your mind later. That extra $15 may be too much or you may just wish you’d spent it to get the car of your dreams.
                Do your homework before you leave the house. Consider exactly what you need the car for. If you do a lot of commuting, that gas guzzling V-8 may not be your best option. Need to carry your pets around a lot? An SUV could be best. Think about who will be riding with you, if you do more street than freeway driving and if you need a big trunk space. If you’re thinking about a two-door model, be sure that your frequent passengers are able to get in and out of the back seat. Have your tallest family member sit in one if you can, so you can ensure their comfort. Then take the models you are considering and run them through payment calculators while researching the actual value so you know how much of a markup there is. Will it work in the long-term? Will it need to hold carseats? Will it be good for long road trips or vacations? Business travel? 
                Need more time than a test drive will allow? Consider renting a car model that you've got in mind for purchase. You'll have more time to put it through its paces and see if it works for you on a regular day's travels.
                Ask questions. Dealers can be known for extending the length of the process with their negotiation tactics. If a price sounds different or you’re not comfortable with anything you hear, ask about it.
                If there is more than one of you that will be shopping, be on the same page as much as you can — at least in front of any dealer staff. If you don’t agree, ask for a few moments of privacy to talk without any pressure.
                Go to more than one dealership to be sure you’re comfortable with the staff, the location and the distance from your home, as this may be where you’ll need to get work done. If it’s too far, will it be too inconveniencing to return for maintenance? If you don’t like the staff or there is no place to work while you wait, consider how you’ll have to handle that for future visits. Another good question is if they provide shuttle for service appointments.
                Inspect the car thoroughly. A Carfax is a wonderful tool, and be sure to test drive it on a couple of different locations so you can see how fast it accelerates, brakes and turns. It may handle much differently than you are used to and sometimes the adjustment is not worth it. Ask the salesman to go over it all with you. If you have a phone connection, ask them to set it up before you leave. You are paying a lot and they should be willing to help you all the way out the driveway.
                Don’t forget parking. Will it fit in your garage or carport? Does it have an alarm so your insurance rates are lower and so it’s safe if parked outside? 
                Do I need a maintenance agreement or extra warranty package? Look at the cost and ask for the loan payment figures with and without. Read the coverages carefully. Many can be worth it, especially if your car is a sports vehicle. Getting car rental coverage is helpful and often adds very little cost to the package, even if you only need it during maintenance.</p>
